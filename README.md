# Examinating
A Website for students at Trinity College Dublin to more easily navigate the past examination papers. (In the very early stages of development.)

## Overview
The idea for this project is to mimic what has already been done for Computer Science students with www.github.com/nating/trinity-cs-website, for students of every faculty of the college. This will be done by scraping the existing examination resource links and collecting these scrapings together into nice template webpages.  

Once this has been done, the project will be considered a success, but the next step is for students/lecturers with knowledge of the modules which are presented on the website to put forward links to be included to help students of those modules with their study.  

The result of this should be beneficial to all members of the college community, although as described in https://github.com/nating/trinity-cs-website#adding-value for real value to be added to the project, experts on the examinations in each faculty will have to split past examination papers into topics.

The splitting of past examination papers into topics is of great benefit for those studying for exams, but may not be seen as great benefit by some for those learning for the real world. Unfortunately I feel it unlikely that experts in faculties will be willing to do this.
