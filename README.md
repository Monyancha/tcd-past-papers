<img src="/public/logo.png" width="100px"></img>

A Website for students at Trinity College Dublin to more easily navigate the past examination papers.

It is currently live at: https://tcdpastpapers.firebaseapp.com/

## Overview
The idea for this project is to mimic what has already been done for Computer Science students with www.github.com/nating/trinity-cs-website (https://nating.netsoc.ie), for students of every faculty of the college.  

## Where we at?
The src files are java programs that scrape the pages of various different formats at https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/exams/ and place past paper information into CSV or JSON files.

The html files are being hosted on https://tcdpastpapers.firebaseapp.com/ and the JSON files are being stored on the server there.  

The last things left to do before doing a beta release of the project are to fix up the last issues and finish up with the website's design.
