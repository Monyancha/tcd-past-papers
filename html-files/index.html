            <p>This website is to help students at Trinity College navigate the past examination papers more efficiently.<br><br>
                
                Find modules that have past examination papers you want quicker access to and add them to your-modules by ticking the box beside them. When you visit the <a>home-page</a> in future, the modules you have ticked will be shown there and you can get to past papers in less clicks.<br><br>
                
                Some courses have past questions split into topics, so that you can quickly access past questions on a specific topic you have been studying.<br>
                If you have a genuinely deep understanding of the past papers for a particular module (like say for instance, you wrote them...) and you would like to help splitting the past question into topics (like modules here), then please get in touch.<br><br>
                
                If you have any useful links for modules, have bugs to report, or have any general feedback, please contact nating@tcd.ie<br><br>
                
                We hope you find the website helpful!</p>
